         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The thing in it ſelf, you will not chuſe but like, for it is excellent; and I am but too ſure, that you wil loue the part that I haue therein; becauſe the ſame Loue hath ceeled vp the eyes of your iudgement concerning me.

The laſt of the <hi>Tytles,</hi> deliuered to vs by our Authour, I haue heere tranſlated; and you may ſee, that he is a Lyon by his nayles.</p>
            <p>In this diſcourſe of <hi>Iudge,</hi> which is not founded vpon priuate contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, and much leſſe, either vpon looſe coniections, or ſtreyned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts; but euen wholy in effect, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the paſſages of holy Scriptures (though not cyted word for word, but duely pondered, and truly para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſed, as the beſt ſpirituall wryters are wont to do) he doth admirably<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21022:6"/>deſcribe the ſoueraigne Maieſty, the incomparable Mercy, and the inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Iuſtice of our <hi>Iudge.</hi> And (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident heerunto) he deliuers vs ſuch a Mappe of the next world; and doth ſo deſcribe the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of heauen, &amp; the <hi>Zona Torrida</hi> of hell, as may ſerue, either to rauiſh vs with ioy, or ſtrike vs through with horrour, and make vs euen wither, for woe; according to the ſeueral ſtate that we may be in. If we be members of the true Church of Chriſt our Lord; and if, withall, we be in the ſtate of grace, we ſhall looke with more hope vpon the ioyes of heauen, then with feare, vpon the torments of hell; and ſo, we ſhall get courage in the good courſe begun. But if, on the other ſide, we be cut off from the communion of the true Church of Chriſt our Lord, by any one errour in beliefe; or if yet, being Catholikes, we be remaining in ſtate of mortal ſinne, this Treatiſe, I hope,<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21022:7"/>wil help to guide vs by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out of thoſe Labyrinths; &amp; place vs in that high way of Fayth &amp; Charity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we can haue no tytle to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but the

            <p>Let no man therfore be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or rather let no man deceaue himſelfe. God is God, and he wilbe ſerued. And it is all reaſon, that, by our beleeuing, and liuing as we ought, true Homage may be done to that infinite, inuiſible, immortall, and moſt pure Maieſty of his. And man is man; a thing of nothing, for of nothing he was made. And as now he is, what is he, but a Pedlars-ſhop full of traſh; or rather a very ſincke full of filth; and to what height of honour ought he eſteeme himſelfe to be aduanced, if he had but euen a ſingle leaue, to ſerue &amp; loue ſuch an omnipotent Creator? But now, ſince beſides this, he is to be rewarded
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21022:7"/>with an immortall Crowne of glory for ſo doing (the ſublime excellency wherof, no created power can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend) what meruayle can it be, that the torments be alſo infinite, to which he ſhalbe adiudged and chay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; if inſteed of doing reuerence to God, by imbracing an incorrupted faith, &amp; leading either an innocent, or penitent life, he enter into rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and treaſon againſt him, by imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any errour in beleefe, or falling into ſenſuality, or any one other mortall ſin, if withall, he dye therin, without repentance.</p>
            <p>It is not want of Charity, in them who ſay, That all ſuch as dye with any mortall ſinne vpon their ſoules ſhall eternally be tormented in the fyre of hell; but it is true Charity to declare this truth, that ſo, in tyme men may know to what to truſt. <hi>S. Paul</hi> abounded, and ouerflowed with <hi>Charity;</hi> and that very <hi>Charity</hi> it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21022:8"/>was, which obliged him to proclaim this doctrine;<note place="margin">

Of theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I foretell you, as I haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told you, that they which do ſuch things as theſe, ſhall not obtaine the kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if theſe Sinnes doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude men from heauen, others alſo which are as grieuous, wilbe as ſure to exclude them; and the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will they exclude them, the more grieuous, and enormous they fall out to be. For if ſimple fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe make a ſoule lyable to the paines of hell, what will not Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try do? If for a priuate emnity with a mans neighbour, he ſhalbe adiudged<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21022:8"/>to thoſe eternall and vnquenchable flames, what ſhall be not be, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the Church of Chriſt our Lord, by vnbeleeuing any doctrine, or diſobeying the gouernement ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</p>
            <p>I ſay the vnbeleeuing of any doctrine, as before I ſaid of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any other mortall ſinne. For this is as true, in the law of our faith, as it is, in the law of our life, That, <hi>Qui in vno peccat omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> factus est reus; he that offends in one, is made guilty of all.</hi> Not that he who offends in all, ſhall not be more deepely damned, then he that doth it but in one; but becauſe whoſoeuer ſhall haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mortally againſt any one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of our Lord God, which concerneth good life, or any errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine, in difference from the Catholike beliefe, is moſt truely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be a breaker of the Law of God, and a corruptour of his truth;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21022:9"/>and that as ſuch a one, he ſhall periſh, except he repent. Woe be therefore to them (and of woe they will be one day ſure) who bringe ſuch falſe weights into the world; and who prophane the law of God, and not onely the law, but the law-giuer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; In that they allow him not to be a perfect hater, and a ſeuere puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of all mortall ſinne, in what ſoule ſoeuer it be found.

            </p>
            <p>This is then the verdict of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Saints of the holy Catholik Church, and of the Apoſtle Saint Paul; yea and ſo the holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21022:11"/>who wrote by his penne, and which is euery where cleerly giuen, to proue this certaine truth, That <hi>any one mortall ſinne, whether it might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt good life, or true beliefe,</hi> doth ſhut vp the gates of heauen againſt vs, &amp; ſet open the bottomleſſe Abyſſe of hell to ſwallow vs, vnleſſe we repent thereof ſincerely, before our death.</p>
            <p>The hower of which death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo wholy hidden from vs, it will infinitely concerne vs, both inſtantly and exactly, to caſt vp all the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts of our Conſcience; to be cordially ſorry for all our ſinns; to confeſſe them diſtinctly; to purpoſe an amendment firmely; and to ſatiſfy for them intierly. For this is a buſines which muſt not be diſpatcht after a curſory and ſuperficiall manner; but we are to conſider with what care we would conſult about our eſtats, if they were in danger; or about our liues, if they lay on bleeding. And<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21022:12"/>heer we muſt not faile to vſe ſo much more delige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then there, as <hi>Eternity</hi> is of more importance, then a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Tyme.</hi> And in fine, we are to do it ſo, as, at the hower of our death, (when we ſhall go to ſtand before our <hi>Iudge</hi>) we would be glad that we had done it. For without this true repentance which ſignifieth a flight from ſinne with griefe; and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a flight towards God with loue, it is no Faith in Chriſt our Lord, which will ſerue the turne to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vs out of that lake of eternall torment. But rather, the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we ſhall haue had of him by <hi>Faith,</hi> the greater will our torment be, if we do not pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nance for the ſinns which we ſhal haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt that Maieſty of his Which, the ſame <hi>Fayth</hi> telleth vs to be infinite; and that his hatred againſt ſinne is alſo infinite; and that as, with ſtrange mercy, he will aſſume to incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21022:12"/>immortall ioy, the ſoule, which at that day he ſhall find to be free from ſinne; ſo in whomſoeuer he he ſhall perceaue, that ſin remaines, the ſame ſoule will he then inſtantly adiudg to that ſea of fire &amp; brimſton, where it will ſaile in ſorrow, &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and rage, for all eternity.</p>
            <p>To the pretious <hi>Death,</hi> &amp; <hi>Paſſion</hi> of Chriſt our Lord, we owe &amp; muſt acknowledg (amongſt innumerable others) this vnſpeakeable benefit (for which let all the Angells for euer bleſſe &amp; praiſe his holy name), That through the infinite merit therof, we may be receiued to grace, by meanes of true contrition and pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nance; how often, and how wickedly ſoeuer, we ſhall haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that high Maieſty. But that <hi>Death</hi> &amp; <hi>Paſsion,</hi> will neuer ſaue the ſoule of any one creature, vnleſſe both that myſtery, and all the other myſteries of Catholike faith, be well beleeued, &amp; al ſinne be cordially<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21022:13"/>deteſted; which ſinne, is a monſter, ſo fierce and cruell, as that it did coſt the very ſonne of God his life. By that life, and by that death I begge, that thou wilt giue ouer to trample with thy durty feete, in the ſacred Bloud Royall of our B. Sauiour, which he ſhed for thee vpon the Croſſe. For ſo thou doſt, preferring
<hi>Barabbas</hi> before him, as often as thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteſt any mortall ſinne; and ſo long thou haſt continued to doe it, as thy ſoule hath beene ſpotted with that crime.</p>

            <p>THIS moſt mercifull <hi>Iudg,</hi> hath giuen vs ſome moſt euident teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, of the moſt ardent deſire which he hath, not to condemne vs in his diuine <hi>Iudgment;</hi> but to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs as free &amp; ſafe, &amp; that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence may wholy paſſe in fauour of vs. One of theſe teſtimonies, and that a very admirable one, is this; That before he would come, the ſecond tyme, to make an <hi>vniuerſall Iudgment</hi> of ſinners, &amp; to condemne &amp; puniſh ſuch as he ſhould finde to be faulty,
<note n="a" place="margin">Marke this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for it is ful of truth and comfort.</note> he came, in that firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of his, to paſſe a <hi>Iudgment</hi> vpon ſinns themſelues; to deſtroy, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and to depriue them of being,<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21022:21"/>and life; and in like manner alſo to paſſe a <hi>Iudgement,</hi> againſt all the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our ſoules namely the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Diuell;</hi> and to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and diſpoſſeſſe them of all power, and Tytle, which they might make to men; and to defeate thoſe forces which they mainteyned to the preuidice of mens ſoules; and to giue men ſtrength, and meanes, wherby they might defend themſelues, and obteine perfect victory againſt them all. That ſo, when he ſhould come to paſſe a <hi>Iudgment</hi> vpon men, he might finde them free from ſinne; and if not all of them, yet ſo many, at leaſt, as would take profit by the grace he gaue them; and conſequently that he might haue nothing to puniſh in them. Yea and moreouer, that he might finde them conquerours ouer their enemies, that ſo he might giue them that reward of glory, for their victory, which he had promiſed to<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21022:22"/>ſuch as ſhould ouercome.</p>
            <p>This is that high <hi>Myſtery</hi> which Chriſt our Lord diſcouered to vs in the Ghoſpell, ſomtyme ſaying,<note place="margin">

8.</note> 
               <hi>Now is Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to paſse vpon the world.</hi> Our Lord meanes to ſay heerby, as himſelf declares, That at his firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming when he came, in a mortal and paſſible body, he came not to paſſe a
<hi>Iudgement</hi> vpon men, to chaſtiſe &amp; condemne the wicked, by doing Iuſtice, and pronouncing a ſentence of condemnation againſt them. For if he had come to this end, and that he would haue paſſed this
<hi>Iudgement</hi> at his firſt comming; he would, in effect, haue bin obliged to comdem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne all the world; for, in effect he <pb n="43" facs="tcp:21022:22"/>found them all in ſin; and euen thoſe few Iuſt perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s who were free, were ſo, in vertue of his being come to ſaue them. And if that firſt coming of his, had beene to <hi>Iudge</hi> men, euen thoſe few had alſo bene in ſtate of ſinne, and had beene condemned. He ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore explicates himſelfe by ſaying <hi>I came not to iudg the world, but to ſaue it,</hi> That is, I came not as a Iudge, but as a Sauiour, I came not to condemne ſinners by doing Iuſtice on them, &amp; by paſſing a ſentence of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on againſt them; But
<note n="b" place="margin">Chriſt our Lord deliuereth no man from the paynes of hell, by his ſacred Paſſion, but ſuch as firſt are deliuered by it from ſinne.</note> I came to ſaue them, by ſuffering and dying for them, and by communicating my Iuſtice and merits to them; that ſo I might free them from ſinne, and Iuſtify them; and giue them the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall health of grace, and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory. And to this very office of ſauing men, is ordeyned that <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which he ſaith he came to make in that firſt comming, and which he<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21022:23"/>was to paſſe againſt ſinnes, &amp; againſt the diuell alſo in fauour of men. So doth he declare himſelfe, ſaying: Through my Paſſion and Death, Iudgment is now to paſſe, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is to be giuen, in fauour of the men of this world, againſt the diuell. For till now, he held men ſubiect, and captiued vnder his power and tyranny; but now, by the payment which I am making for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are to remaine ſafe and free. Now, the diuell, who is the Prince of this world, who held men ſubiect vnder ſinne, is to be depoſed from that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which he held in the world; for innumerable ſoules, which were captiued in error and ſinne, are to be conuerted and ſaued; and remedy ſhalbe imparted to them all, wherby they may be deliuered from him, and may obtaine eternall glory.</p>
            <p>So alſo, in that firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt our Lord to ſaue mankind,<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21022:23"/>he made a kind of diſtinguiſhing and deuiding
<hi>Iudgement,</hi> betweene the good, and the bad; the elect, and the reprobate. For when he was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and working miracles, and procuring the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world; ſome did profit by his comming, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing his fayth, and obeying his Ghoſpell, &amp; participating of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And others againe, becauſe they would not belieue in him, nor ſerue themſelues of his remedyes, did ſtill remaine in their ſins; yea, &amp; through their ingratitude, and the hardnes of their harts, they grew therein. And thus by the occaſion of the comming of Chriſt our Lord, the diſtinction grew more apparent, betweene the faythful &amp; the vnfaithfull; between Iuſt perſons, and ſinners; betweene the elect, and ſuch as were reproued by God.</p>
            <p>For they who receaued the faith of Chriſt, &amp; did follow him, by the<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21022:24"/>imitation of his life, &amp; by the taking vp of his Croſſe, according to their
<note n="c" place="margin">That is according to the ſtate, wherein they were at that tyme.</note> preſent iuſtice, were iuſt perſons; &amp; as long as they did perſeuere, they had ſignes in them, of being prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated; and they who receaued not the fayth, according to their then preſent ſtate, were wicked &amp; repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate This did our Lord declare, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayd: <hi>I came into this world, that they who ſee not, might ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; &amp; they who ſee might be blind.</hi> Which was as much to ſay, Vpon my comming, did this iudgment follow, and this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made amongſt men; that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who in their ſoules were blind, through ignorance and errour, and vice, and who did not ſee the truth, nor did walke in the right way to heauen, by beleeuing in me, with a liuely fayth, they I ſay, might ſee the truth, and follow it. And that many others, who ſaw, and had knowledg of the Scriptures, and did know the <pb n="47" facs="tcp:21022:24"/>law, and the Prophets; &amp; who both in their own, and in the peoples opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, &amp; eſtimation, were held wiſe, and had a ſpirituall light wherwith to looke into diuine things; they, I ſay, for their pride and ingratitude, ſhould remaine blind; and, going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray from the right way, ſhould not find their errour and perdition.</p>
            <p>Another diuine and moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular teſtimony, which Chriſt our Lord hath giuen vs, of the deſire which he hath, in this iudgment of his, not to finde any ſinnes which he might puniſh, nor any ſinners whom he ſhould be ſo obliged to condemne, is, That
<note n="d" place="margin">Let all Angells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him for this ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to men.</note> at his firſt comming he made a law, which was to laſt till the end of the world, wherby he gaue faculty to all ſinners, that during the whole tyme whilſt their life ſhould laſt, they might paſſe a <hi>Iudgement</hi> vpon themſelues; acknowledging their ſinns, and accuſing themſelues <pb n="48" facs="tcp:21022:25"/>therof with greefe, and confeſſing them to a Prieſt, who ſhould hould the place of Chriſt our Lord; and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfying for them, according to the iudgment of the ſame Ghoſtly father; and that they performing this, he would not, in his
<hi>Iudgment,</hi> either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne or puniſh them, but would declare them to be <hi>not Guilty,</hi> and would impart the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that, if hauing once paſſed this <hi>Iudgement</hi> vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they ſhould yet return againe to ſinne, &amp; become abnoxious ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eternall condemnation; yet ſtil as long as their life ſhould laſt, they might returne to paſſe the ſame <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> vpon themſelus, as often as they would; and that if they ſhould do it according to
<note n="e" place="margin">Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing them all clearely with great ſorrow &amp; firme pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> 
               <hi>Truth,</hi> he would not condemne them, but would admit them into his company, and make them happy. O <hi>Iudgment</hi> which is ſo deerely ſweet! O <hi>Iudge,</hi> who is ſo ful <pb n="49" facs="tcp:21022:25"/>of mercy! and how vnanſwerable is it proued by this moſt pitteous <hi>Iudge,</hi> that his intention and deſire, is not to puniſh but to pardon; not to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, but to abſolue and ſaue; ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes to paſſe his <hi>Iudgment,</hi> he vſeth ſo many meanes, &amp; applyes ſo many remedies, to the end that he may finde no ſinnes to puniſh, nor no ſinners to condemne.</p>
            <p>If an earthly <hi>Iudge,</hi> had his priſon ful of delinquents &amp; theeues, &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and ſhould make a kind of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and bargaine with them, that

            <p>Since then the hatred which God doth carry againſt ſinne, is ſo very great; ſince the puniſhment which he will execute vpon ſinners in that <hi>Iudgment</hi> of his is ſo immenſe; O it is full of reaſon, that from the faith and infallible notice which we haue of this truth, all we, who are beleeuers, ſhould fetch a knowledge of the grieuouſnes of ſinne; and a perfect deteſtation of the ſame, and a profound griefe and ſorrow for ſuch ſinne as we haue already co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted; &amp; much feare in reſpect of them which<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21022:30"/>we may commit heerafter.

            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:21022:33"/>Let vs now ſee why God did not content himſelfe, with cauſing the men who had ſinned to be put to death, but the beaſts alſo, which had no fault. It was to make men vnderſtand and feele, that ſinne is ſo great a miſcheife, and is ſo worthy to be abhorred and puniſht, and that God doth indeed, ſo much abhor it, that it is a moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient thing, not onely to puniſh ſinners with eternall torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; death, but to deſtroy alſo, and conſume, and as it were to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the creatures wherof they did ſerue &amp; help the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues towards their ſinnes. Therfore is it, that reſoluing in the <hi>Vniuerſall Iudgment</hi> to chaſtice the wickednes of all men, in a moſt complete manner, he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelfe to deliuer ouer ſinners themſelues to thoſe eternall ardours of fire &amp; thoſe other immenſe paines of hell; but to the creaturs alſo wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they made ſome vſe in ſinning, he<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21022:33"/>giues as it were a kind of payne, and puniſhment, in deteſtation of the ſins themſelues; as alſo, to the end that they may be purged, and cleered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that indecency, and deformity which grew to them, by the ſeruice, which they did to ſinners. For thus it is, that the
<hi>Sunne,</hi> the <hi>Moone,</hi> &amp; <hi>Stars,</hi> which did illuminate ſinners whileſt they were committing their ſinnes, ſhalbe depriued by him for a whyle, of all the light, &amp; beauty which they haue, &amp; he ſhall conuert it into thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And as for the <hi>Sea,</hi> &amp; the
<hi>Earth,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ayre,</hi> which gaue food to ſinners, &amp; did maintaine them, whileſt they were offending God, he will make them as it were feare, and tremble, &amp; will depriue them, for a tyme, of the naturall quality and diſpoſition they haue; and will conſume, and kill all thoſe liuing creatures, and plantes, which were the food of ſinners; and wil deſtroy al thoſe buildings, which<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21022:34"/>were the habitation of wicked men. And thus, through the mutation, &amp; demonſtration, &amp; deſolation which in the <hi>Iudgment,</hi> God will ſhew in al the creatures which ſerued ſinners, he doth teach and teſtify the infinite ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which he hath againſt ſin. And he doth induce, &amp; perſwade vs, that now, through the knowledge of this truth, we may be drawn to abhor &amp; deteſt them; and that with a peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall &amp; holy life, we may cleanſe our ſoules, as well as poſſibly we can, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al fault &amp; offence of his diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21022:46"/>for the diuell and his wicked Angells.</hi> For the principall authors of any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, the puniſhement is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be prouided; and becauſe the deuill, was the firſt author of ſinne, therfore was the torment of eternall fier, prouided firſt for him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wicked men did follow the deuill in the fault, they ſhall follow him alſo in the paine. And becauſe they choſe to obey the perſwaſion &amp; will of the deuill, rather then the commaundement and will of God; they ſhall therfore haue him for their tormentor, and companion, in that euerlaſting fier.</p>

The thing, which in this life <pb n="92" facs="tcp:21022:47"/>doth moſt of all torment, and doth cauſe moſt exceſſiue paine, is fire. But the fire of this life, doth worke after a limitted manner, according to the naturall power which it hath; &amp; it cannot paſſe beyonde thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines. Wheras the fire of hell, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be of the ſame nature with this of ours, yet worketh it as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall inſtrument of God; and ſo it receiues no other tax or limit, but the onely will of God.

And ſo it ſhall not onely torment the body, but the ſoule with all. And it ſhall not leaue anie one part, or power either of body or ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le vntormented; and the torment &amp; greife which it will cauſe, ſhalbe greater then all, which either we can ſay, or thinke.</p>

            <p>THE faythfull Chriſtian, from the conſideration of this diuine
<hi>Iudgement,</hi> is to draw a very reall, &amp; true feare of God. And this feare of God, and of his <hi>Iudgment,</hi> is the moſt particuler and proper fruite, which from that <hi>Iudgment,</hi> is to be drawn.

            <p>So alſo, when a faithfull ſeruant of God, through the deſire which he hath to flye from al offence of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty, and in all thinges to comply with his holy wil, doth ſettle himſelfe after a ſincere, and ſerious manner, to conſider the <hi>Iudgements</hi> of God, and thoſe eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and tormentes, whereby he is to take vengance vpon the wicked, thereby to moue himſelfe ſo much the more, to a feare of thoſe <hi>Iugdme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> and paynes; and the more to animate himſelfe to flye from all offence of God, and to keep his diuine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; this feare, howſoeuer it carry a kind of reſpect to paine, is not yet to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted a <hi>ſeruile feare.</hi> Nor doth it ſpring from ſelfe loue,<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21022:67"/>but it is a <hi>filiall loue,</hi> and it growes from Charity.

And he may alſo come to preſume vpon himſelfe; conceauing that he doth greatly loue God; and by that very meanes, he goes diſpoſing himſelfe, to looſe the ſame loue of God, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinnes, &amp; by increaſing in them; he arriueth alſo to fall at laſt, into mortall ſinne, wherby he doth wholy looſe <hi>loue</hi> and grace. But in the meane tyme, this negligence which grew to end in mortall ſinne, doth not <pb n="138" facs="tcp:21022:70"/>grow from that very <hi>loue</hi> of God, which of it ſelfe is all good, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth vs alſo to all good; but

            <p>It is therfore both very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and very fit, &amp; euen neceſſary, that the good Chriſtian, do ioyne the holy Feare of God, to the <hi>loue</hi> of him; and that as he is to exerciſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in ſome conſiderations which may moue him to <hi>loue</hi> God, ſo alſo he may exerciſe himſelf in ſome other, which may moue him to <hi>feare</hi> him.</p>

            <p>THIS is the firſt way of anſw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that which was demaunded. The

<note n="b" place="margin">Filiall fear riſeth out of loue.</note> this holy feare ſpringeth out of the true <hi>loue</hi> of God; and imbraceth the ſame <hi>loue</hi> as the fountaine, &amp; roote from whence it ſprings.

            <p>GREAT are the benefits which we find in that diuine

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21022:79"/>which was wrought by Chriſt our Lord.</hi> This is of the Apoſtle.

For hauing reckoned vp the ſigns which are to appeare before his comming to <hi>Iudgement,</hi> and the feare and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row wherewith they ſhallbe recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the wicked; turning then his diſcourſe to his diſciples (and in their perſons to all ſuch as would be their imitatours, and were to be aliue at that tyme) he ſayth, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>When theſe thinges ſhall arriue, which are to precede my comming, do you lift vp your heads Be not diſquieted, be not diſmayd, giue no place to ſorrow, none to feare, or to distrust, as the louers of the world will do, who will go with<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21022:80"/>the head all hanging downe like men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and diſmayd But haue you great confidence, conceaue great courage, be cheerefull and reioyce, and with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and ioy lift vp your harts &amp; your face, to God, for now your redemption draweth neere.

            </p>
            <p>Another great fauour to the iuſt, willbe, to ſee, appearing in the ayre (and that high vp neer heauen, and before the perſon of Chriſt our Lord) the ſigne, and ſtandard of the moſt holy
<note n="e" place="margin">Happy ſoules, which heere are deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Croſſe of Chriſt our Lord</note> Croſſe, not made of wood, or mettall, but of other moſt glorious matter, and more brightly ſhining, &amp; incomparably with more beauty, then the ſunne; and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion ſo very large, that being <pb n="159" facs="tcp:21022:80"/>plac't on high, it may be ſeene ouer the whole earth, by all the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thereof. For a matter and motiue it is of incomparable comfort &amp; ioy, for them to ſee in ſuch high honour and glory, that Croſſe, which they adored, as the Image of Chriſt, and which they loued, by enduring and ſuffering affronts and paynes for his ſake. When
<note n="f" place="margin">A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, &amp; yet a plain conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> a worldly man doth hate any thing, or any perſon, and ſeeth it or him aduanced to honour, it puts him to payne. Wicked men, in this life, did abhorre the Croſſe of Chriſt, becauſe they did extremely loue the pleaſures and delicacyes, &amp; tranſitory honours of this world, &amp; they deteſted to ſuffer paine &amp; ſham in the vertue, and for the loue of Chriſt our Lord. So doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it ſaying:<note place="margin">

For thereby they ſhall more cleerely ſee their errour, and the eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which is prepared for them. For that, is to be the end of ſuch men, as the ſame Apoſtle decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſaying: <hi>VVhoſe end, is death, and the deſtruction of their ſoules.</hi>

For as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">

               <hi>They who are of Christ, and who re liuely members of him, and who haue his ſpirit, and who are gouerned by him, doe crucify their fleſh, and chaſtiſe it with penances, and by willingly imbracing thoſe affronts &amp; paynes, which God preſents And by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting their fleſh, in this manner, they doe withall, destroy and kill the vices, and ill deſires which ſprout from thence.</hi> Now when the ſeruants of God, ſhal ſee that Croſſe,

               <q rend="inline">"<hi>When the ſonne of man ſhall come to iudge,</hi> he ſhall ſit vpon the throne of his Maieſty, &amp; all the nations of the earth ſhalbe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled before him; and, as the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard deuides the ſheepe from the Goates, ſo ſhall he deuide the good and bad from one another."</q> The good he calleth <hi>ſheep,</hi> for the innocency, ſimplicity, meeknes, &amp; fruitefulnes in good works wherwith they abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <pb n="164" facs="tcp:21022:83"/>and the wicked he calleth <hi>Goates,</hi> for their barrennes in doing any thing that is good; and for the ill odour of their vices, and the impetuouſnes of their paſſions, to which they are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biect. Three things there are, which do principally afflict and torment the good, when they are in company of the bad. Firſt, they ſee before their eyes, many and great offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God, and they are not able to preuent them. This
<note n="a" place="margin">He that finds not this griefe in his hart is not ſo much in loue with God, as he perhaps conceaues</note> is a greiuous torment; and the more they loue God, &amp; the fulfilling of his lawe, ſo much greater is the griefe which they conceaue, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him offended, and it deſpiſed. This did <hi>S. Peter</hi> explicate, when he ſaid of

            </p>
            <p>Another thing which afflicteth<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21022:83"/>good men, when they liue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with ſuch as are wicked, is the danger

For as the example of the good, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to the loue of vertue, ſo doth the example of the wicked to the loue of vice.

            <p>The third thing which afflicteth good men, who finde themſelues in the company of wilfull ſinners, is<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21022:84"/>feare to be puniſhed ioyntly with them. For although, in this life, God doth not puniſh the ſoule of one, for the ſins of another; yet

            <p>Theſe are the things which put good men in paine, when they are in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of the wicked.

And yet further to know that then they are free for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, from all kind of puniſhment; &amp; from all danger to ſuffer any.

               <hi>As the Hart with being chaſed and tired, and hauing deadly thirſt, deſires the waters and goes panting vp and downe in ſearch therof; ſo my ſoule being ouerwrought by the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this life, deſireth thee o my God &amp; hath a mighty thirst, and an vnſatiable appetit towards thee who art the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the liuing water both of grace &amp; glory, which can only ſatiſfie and appeaſe my whole appetit.

And much more, and with more reaſon, did the Saints of the <hi>newe Testament</hi> performe the ſame, and ſo ſhould all true Chriſtians do. Firſt becauſe till the paſſion of Chriſt our Lord was paſt, the Saints, how fully ſoeuer they were purged from all ſinne and paine, went not yet to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <pb n="212" facs="tcp:21022:107"/>but to the

               <hi>men who striue, and fight with others, in the place deputed to that end (as the vſe of the Romains was to do in their entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements and feaſts) do for the ouercom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming of their oppoſites, abstaine from all thoſe thinges of guſt, which may be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impediment to them in their combat, as namely from delicate meates, from wine, from women, and the like, which are wont to make men dull, and weake; and they feed vpon groſſe meats, they obſerue the rules of continency and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and they prepare and accustome themſelues before hand, to labour.

And if it were neceſſary, not only to ſuffer all the paines of this life, but to endure (yea and that for many ages) all the torments of hell, yea and of many hells; it
